Dave Howard was born in the small city of Portland, Maine. He joined the Marine Corps at 18 and served 4 years. After leaving the Marine Corps, he worked a few jobs in different industries, eventually working for several years for a travel broker where he soon became disillusioned with the 9-5 grind.

He eventually left everything behind in 2017 and moved to southern Utah to be a wilderness guide, where he found his passion for adventure, among other things.

Now he's back again and ready to share his newest adventure with the world, with the hope that it can be an inspiration to others to follow their dreams as well.

Dave Howard is an adventure seeker from Portland, Maine. After leaving the Marine Corps, he worked many different jobs, eventually working for several years for a travel broker where he soon became disillusioned with the 9-5 grind.

He eventually left everything behind in 2017 and moved to southern Utah to be a wilderness guide, where he found his passion for adventure, among other things.

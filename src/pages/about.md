Dave Howard is an adventure seeker from Portland, Maine. After leaving the Marine Corps, he worked many different jobs, eventually working for several years for a travel broker where he soon became disillusioned with the 9-5 grind.

He eventually left everything behind in 2017 and moved to southern Utah to be a wilderness guide, where he found his passion for adventure, among other things.

Now he's back again and ready to share his newest adventure with the world, with the hope that it can be an inspiration to others to follow their dreams as well.

I finally did it!



I've been preparing for this day for months. So much research with youtube videos and reading to get me to this point. 

I put my boat in the water about a week before filming this, but had some really poor weather conditions so I was unable to sail. I got stuck in some terrifying winds while sitting at anchor that I was NOT prepared for but managed to survive somehow. 



It's been quite an experience living on a sailboat. I'm really enjoying it so far. My boat is pretty small though. It feels more like comfortable (most of the time) camping, rather than a home on the water. Fortunately, I really dig camping.



Figuring out how to setup all the rigging was probably the hardest part. I was really nervous that I was going to do it wrong and end up capsized, but I eventually figured it out.



The sailing went relatively smoothly after a bit. It feels really intuitive. It took me a bit to figure out how to trim the sails correctly for each point of sail, but I'm getting there. 



Ever since I was a kid, I've wanted to sail around Portland Head Light in Cape Elizabeth, and I finally got to see that dream come true. It was pretty exhilarating. The wind started to pick up, and the swells in the open ocean were alot bigger than in the protected harbor I started in, and I got scared and turned around. Baby steps!

After working for the local couple for a few days, I felt like it was time to move on. I still need to get to Portland and fix my solar panels.
I spent the first half of the day beating upwind into some interesting waves. Wayfinder dancing up the bay as she tacked back and forth.
Once we reached the open ocean, I trimmed the sails for a close reach and sailed southwest. I had high hopes to make it to Portland by the end of the day.

Shortly after passing the lighthouse in Boothbay Harbor, the wind slowed drastically and it began to rain. I didn't mind the rain. Wayfinder has been collecting pollen for several days and needed a bath, anyways. But once the wind speed dropped, our speed almost halved, and I knew Portland would be out of the question if it didn't pick back up.

Eventually, I hove to, and looked for a marina. I needed to resupply. I was getting low on water. And I needed to do laundry.
I changed my course sailed towards Boothbay. I am grateful, at least, that shore power is giving my battery a much needed full charge.

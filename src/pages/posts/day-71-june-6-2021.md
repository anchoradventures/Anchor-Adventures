I decided to stay in the cozy cove I anchored in last night for another day. The very light breeze coming from the direction I need to go cemented my decision. I spent the morning enjoying the scenery and catching some sun. A kayaker stopped by and we chatted for a while. It felt good to just strike up conversation with a stranger, especially after the social distancing Covid brought, and lately my relative isolation on Wayfinder.

The temperature today made me realize that I need some form of cover in the cockpit. The cabin felt too humid even with all my hatches open but i also didn't want to sit in the sun all day and fry. I settled for stripping down occasionally and jumping in the cold Maine ocean.

I reconnected with an old friend via a phone call later in the afternoon, and we made loose plans to see each other. I don't feel particularly lonely right now. I've always been okay with solitude. However, that conversation reminded me of some people that I greatly miss. My people. My community. And though the thought crosses my mind, tempts me, to abandon this dream and return to the familiar, I know that doing so would be an unforgivable injury to my soul.

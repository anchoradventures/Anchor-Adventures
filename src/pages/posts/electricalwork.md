We're getting closer and closer to launch day and I've been able to take advantage of the warmer weather to do some work on the boat.

I upgraded the electrical panel and changed out some of the old wiring. It was definitely alot more challenging than I expected. But then again, I didn't really know what to expect as I have zero experience working on boats or with electrical work in general, so it was a fun learning experience as well.

As the days go on, I'm starting to get nervous about what feels like a huge undertaking. I feel like there is so much more I need to learn and so many more things I need to do and things I need to buy to be prepared for my voyage. But at the same time, I am overwhelmed with excitement.

I'm still finishing up planning the journey, but in my next post, I'll finally announce what that plan is.

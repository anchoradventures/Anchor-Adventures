I raised the sails in the morning to a beautiful NW wind, and made my way south on my last leg to Portland. The passage was idyllic. The wind swept over my right shoulder and pushed Wayfinder along at 6 knots the entire way. A few really strong gusts along the way overpowered the low-functioning sheet to tiller system I jury rigged and I had to take control to prevent yawing, but otherwise, it was smooth sailing. I felt ecstatic.


I got into Portland and paid for a slip for the night. I would receive my solar panel parts later in the day and could stop stressing about managing my electricity use so much. Everything was coming together nicely.


I hooked up to dock power for now, and plugged my phone in to charge it. Nothing. I swapped cords, cables, inverters, outlets, restart the phone. Still nothing. My brand new phone would not charge.


I took it to Verizon, who agreed that it would not charge (lol), and had a new one ordered for me which should be hereÂ tomorrow.
Back on Wayfinder, I get the package I've come here for and it's not really what I expected, but I hook it up and.. Nothing. It doesn't fix my problem, and I am at this point extremely frustrated and even disheartened.


When I started this journey, I expected to struggle against the elements. I knew there would be times where I would have tough days. Days that I would feel exhausted or miserable or dejected. Days that would test my spirit and resolve. Days I would want to give up on my dream. I had just expected those struggles to come from nature. From the wind, and the rain, and the ocean. But alas, it is my failing electronics that test my patience today.

I raised the sails and started making my way out of the cove this morning to try and reach Portland and fix my solar panel. As I was starting to sail away, the kayaker I met yesterday stopped me and asked if I would be interested in doing some work.

As much as I want to get my solar panels fixed, I let go of my attachment to that, and, in the spirit of adventure, decided to stay.

He brought out another kayak for me and we kayaked across the cove to his home. I was treated to a delicious lunch, helped him build steps from his house down a steep cliff to the waterfront, and then enjoyed a much needed shower.

The manual labor felt good to my body. I agreed to stick around and help him again tomorrow. Back on Wayfinder, I watch the sun set with gratitude.

When I first began this journey I had intended to record and post videos quite often of my adventures. So far, whether out of sheer laziness or being uncomfortable with actually doing it, I have not lived up to that intention. This is an attempt to compromise with that part of myself that prefers privacy and solitude. Instead of posting videos regularly, I will write.

Today is day 70 living on my small 22 foot boat. Today was a day of rough seas, tossing my boat, Wayfinder, and I around as we sailed close-hauled against occasional 25-30 knot gusts. Today was an epic struggle, and I feel exhausted and accomplished. Prior to today, I was constantly subjected to the tyranny of the tiller, having no auto-pilot or self-steering, but that ended today. I figured out how to rig sheet to tiller steering and I think it changed my life.

The part I need to fix my broken solar panels finally arrived, and I am sailing from Rockland to Portland to collect the package. I made it halfway. Perhaps tomorrow I will make it the rest of the way. Perhaps not. Tonight though, I will sleep soundly knowing that I challenged myself and overcame my fears.
